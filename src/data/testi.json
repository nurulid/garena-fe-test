I tried to look for information about some scholarships. After reading all requirements, contracts, the process of selection of some scholarships, I was strongly interested in SEA Scholarships. The process of selection is not complicated like other scholarships. I\u2019m beyond blessed and grateful because it\u2019s not only about scholarship but I have a new family. I can\u2019t thank enough for SEA Group!\u201d",
